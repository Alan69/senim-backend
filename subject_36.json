So for many centuries the fastest and most popular means of transport was the horse, which can run at about fifty-five kilometres an hour.

Two Frenchmen, the Montgolfier brothers, were working as papermakers when they had the idea for the balloon. A fire heated the air, making the balloon rise. During the first flight, the two passengers were admiring the view when they suddenly saw smoke! The balloon was burning but, luckily, they managed to put the fire out and land safely. The railway developed gradually from carts on tracks. The first vehicle with an engine to run on tracks was developed in 1803 by an Englishman, Richard Trevithick. In 1804, he took the first passengers, although they didn’t have to buy a ticket. Unfortunately, they were travelling in the train when it began to fall off the tracks and Trevithick realised that the tracks were not strong enough to take the weight of the train. The passengers escaped unharmed, but it was another example of how dangerous the development of transport can be. Perhaps unexpectedly, the bicycle didn’t appear until around 1840 when a Scotsman, Kirkpatrick Macmillan, created the first one to have pedals. People rode bicycles without pedals before then, but they were slow and not very popular. It took around 140 years for Macmillan’s design to develop into modern mountain bikes.</p>",

Some time ago, Dinara opened a chess academy in the capital of Kazakhstan, which runs free classes for children from low-income families. Dinara’s book for chess beginners was donated to schools and development centres across the country. In 2017, Dinara Saduakassova became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in Kazakhstan. She’s organised chess tournaments, helped children from orphanages and young people at risk. Dinara said that her role as a UNICEF Ambassador is about promoting and protecting children’s rights.

        "group_text": "<p>Early humans dreamed of going faster and further than they could on foot. They probably fi rst achieved this in northern countries before 3000 BC (before Christ) using skis. The wheel was invented around 3500 BC, but carts were very slow without roads. So for many centuries the fastest and most popular means of transport was the horse, which can run at about fifty-five kilometres an hour. This record for speed was unbroken until the end of the eighteenth century when the hot-air balloon and the railway both began to develop. The hot-air balloon made its first free flight in 1783. Two Frenchmen, the Montgolfier brothers, were working as papermakers when they had the idea for the balloon. A fire heated the air, making the balloon rise. During the first flight, the two passengers were admiring the view when they suddenly saw smoke! The balloon was burning but, luckily, they managed to put the fire out and land safely. The railway developed gradually from carts on tracks. The first vehicle with an engine to run on tracks was developed in 1803 by an Englishman, Richard Trevithick. In 1804, he took the first passengers, although they didn’t have to buy a ticket. Unfortunately, they were travelling in the train when it began to fall off the tracks and Trevithick realised that the tracks were not strong enough to take the weight of the train. The passengers escaped unharmed, but it was another example of how dangerous the development of transport can be. Perhaps unexpectedly, the bicycle didn’t appear until around 1840 when a Scotsman, Kirkpatrick Macmillan, created the first one to have pedals. People rode bicycles without pedals before then, but they were slow and not very popular. It took around 140 years for Macmillan’s design to develop into modern mountain bikes.</p>",

An action which is okay in one country could be illegal in another – like running out of petrol in Germany or not wearing underwear in Thailand!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Singapore has a ban on chewing gum. The reason is that it ruins the city’s clean pavements. Some people support the ban but others don’t see the point. I asked local resident Daniel Xerri how the law started. He explained that one of the main problems was people putting gum on subway train doors so they didn’t open, but he admitted this probably wouldn’t be a problem these days. However, a tourist from Hong Kong thought the ban was a very good thing because it kept the environment clean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many other surprising laws. A popular tourist destination is, of course, Venice. Did you know you can’t feed the pigeons in St Mark’s Square because of the damage done to the ancient monuments? A recent law stated that you can be fined over €500 for this or for selling birdseed. It is typical of a law that has come into existence because of the world’s increasingly dirty cities. London also went ahead with a similar law to protect Trafalgar Square from pigeons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A law which dates back to the 2000s was introduced banning women from wearing high heels to ancient Greek sites, such as the Odeon of Herodes Atticus on the Acropolis in Athens. This monument has survived for 2,000 years and is still used today for special events. It also holds an important arts festival each summer. People dress up to attend these events and women’s high heels can do terrible damage to the ancient stones. Whether you’re travelling near or far, respect local laws and be prepared for the weirder ones!</p>\r\n<quillbot-extension-portal></quillbot-extension-portal>",

An action which is okay in one country could be illegal in another – like running out of petrol in Germany or not wearing underwear in Thailand!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Singapore has a ban on chewing gum. The reason is that it ruins the city’s clean pavements. Some people support the ban but others don’t see the point. I asked local resident Daniel Xerri how the law started. He explained that one of the main problems was people putting gum on subway train doors so they didn’t open, but he admitted this probably wouldn’t be a problem these days. However, a tourist from Hong Kong thought the ban was a very good thing because it kept the environment clean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many other surprising laws. A popular tourist destination is, of course, Venice. Did you know you can’t feed the pigeons in St Mark’s Square because of the damage done to the ancient monuments? A recent law stated that you can be fined over €500 for this or for selling birdseed. It is typical of a law that has come into existence because of the world’s increasingly dirty cities. London also went ahead with a similar law to protect Trafalgar Square from pigeons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A law which dates back to the 2000s was introduced banning women from wearing high heels to ancient Greek sites, such as the Odeon of Herodes Atticus on the Acropolis in Athens. This monument has survived for 2,000 years and is still used today for special events. It also holds an important arts festival each summer. People dress up to attend these events and women’s high heels can do terrible damage to the ancient stones. Whether you’re travelling near or far, respect local laws and be prepared for the weirder ones!</p>\r\n<quillbot-extension-portal></quillbot-extension-portal>",

They also said that humans were the biggest cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report said that nearly half of these species had fewer places to live because of farming, building projects and people cutting down trees. Other major causes, the report said, were hunting and fishing (more than 300 species could disappear completely because humans kill them for food, sport or protection) as well as climate change and pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few positive signs though. In 2010, there were just over 3000 wild tigers left in the world, but experts think their numbers are increasing. There are now an estimated 4,000 tigers in the wild.
