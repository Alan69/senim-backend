The oldest of which, the White Tower, dates back to the 11th century and the time of William the Conqueror. Nowadays a lot of tourists visit the Tower of London, because of the Tower's evil reputation as a prison. The Tower is famous as home of the Crown Jewels. Today changes of the lifestyle can be viewed in their new jewel house. They include the Crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother which contains the celebrated Indian diamond. Many stories associated with British history come from the Tower. In 1483 King Edward IV's two sons were murdered in the so-called Bloody Tower. Over two centuries later the skeletons of two little boys were found buried beneath steps in the White Tower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traitor's Gate has steps leading down to the River Thames. Countless prisoners, including the future Queen Elisabeth I of England, were brought to the Tower by barge and ascended the steps before being imprisoned. For many it was their last moment of freedom before their death. Bu t Elizabeth was released from the Tower and became Queen. The King's second wife, Anne Boleyn, was brought to trial there in 1536 and beheaded. Six years later her cousin, Catherine, Henry VIII's fifth wife, suffered the same fate Thomas More was beheaded there in 1535.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, no visit to the Tower would be complete without seeing the ravens; huge black birds who are an official part of the Tower community. Legend states that if the ravens were to leave the Tower the Crown will fall and Britain with it. Under the special care of the Raven Master, the ravens are fed a daily diet of raw meat. And there is no danger of them trying away, because their wings are clipped.</p>",

However, if you avoid walking down streets where you think there might be a dog, you may have a phobia, which is an irrational reaction to an object or situation that is not necessarily dangerous. A person whose fear has started to change his or her life probably has a phobia. Different surveys say that between ten and eight percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flying may be the safest way to travel, but many people are scared of doing it. Fear of heights is also very common-even Spider –Man actor Tobey Maguire can’t stand them. However, Tobey is not afraid of spiders, which are the creatures that most people are afraid of. Someone who is terrified of spiders is Rupert Grint, who plays Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter films.
